## Welcome to Volunteam

The purpose of this repo is to explore the latest version of Ruby on Rails.  Please see my merged branches for more context of how I built this application over time.  This is still a work in progress.  

This is meant to be a scheduling app for a group of musical volunteers.  Each week, the app will create a group of volunteers to form a band.  I have no current intention of making this app into a finished production product.  I'm just here to sharpen my skills and have fun with my favorite programming language.
